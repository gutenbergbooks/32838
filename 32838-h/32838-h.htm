<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This little pamphlet has been produced at
the request of the <span class="smcap">Toronto Curling Club</span>.
The original object in its publication was
simply to furnish the Members with a copy
of the Constitution of the Club, and of the
laws which they observe in playing. The
design is now extended, so as to embrace a
general description of Curling, with a brief
history of the Game; and by thus making it
to be understood, by those who have never
seen it played, or who may have been only
occasional spectators, to induce a more general
participation in this most healthful and
exhilarating amusement.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to observe the success of the
efforts which have been made in this country,
during the last few years, to promote and
encourage the Game. It is now becoming,
and must become, a favorite in Canada. It
is admirably adapted to this climate, where
the winter is generally cold enough to ensure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">- vi -</a></span>
good ice, and seldom so severe as to render
the exercise unpleasant. Being played in the
open air, during a season when few out-of-door
recreations can be enjoyed, it is well calculated
to counteract the enfeebling influence of
confinement to our close and heated winter
houses. Many objections which may be
brought against other sports, are not applicable
to this. It calls up none of the low and
degrading passions of our nature. Notwithstanding
the intense interest which Curlers
may feel in a well contested match, no
betting ever takes place among them; the
excitement arising from gambling, therefore,
is altogether removed from the rink. Intoxication
on the ice is also unknown among
good players. The nice equilibrium of body
and the firmness of nerve, essential to scientific
Curling, would disappear on the first
symptom of such a state. But the Game is
sufficiently interesting without any extraneous
stimulant. While it imparts vigour to
every limb, and every muscle, it engages the
attention and awakens the judgment; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">- vii -</a></span>
thus brings into healthful excitement those
powers of the body and of the mind, the due
exercise of which the Creator has allied with
pleasure.</p>

<p>In the observations which will be found on
the early history of Curling, a liberal use has
been made of a small but valuable work on
the subject, published anonymously, in Kilmarnock,
in 1828. To the same authority
the writer is indebted for the derivation of
several of the words to be found in the Glossary,
and it is only doing the Compilers of the
work referred to, an act of justice, which they
can have no wish should be omitted, to state,
that they have availed of &ldquo;Doctor Jamieson&rsquo;s
Dictionary,&rdquo; &ldquo;Brewster&rsquo;s Encyclopedia,&rdquo; and
an &ldquo;Account of Curling, by a Member of the
Duddingstone Society.&rdquo; These, unfortunately,
are not at present accessible to the
writer. During the present year, he ordered
from Edinburgh such publications on the
Game, as could be found; but was disappointed
on learning, that several excellent
Treatises which he expected to receive, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">- viii -</a></span>
now out of print&mdash;the only works which his
Correspondent could procure, being the
&ldquo;Annual of the Grand Caledonian Curling
Club&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Rules of Curling, by Pretostes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The writer has affixed his name to this work&mdash;conceiving
that from his official connection
with the Toronto Curling Club, since its
establishment, this may lend some weight to
the opinions, and some authority to the statements
therein contained.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_I" id="PART_I"></a>PART I.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Curling.</span>&mdash;Is a Game played upon the ice,
by sliding stones, made for the purpose, from
one point to another. In some respects it
resembles Bowling, but with these differences,
that the stones are slidden upon the ice, not
rolled&mdash;neither are they made like Bowls, to
curve on their passage; the points, also, to
which the stones are played are stationary,
whereas in Bowling the Jack is moveable; and
in Curling, the ice in the path of the stone
may be polished by sweeping&mdash;and thus the
players may compensate for the want of force
with which a stone may have been thrown.</p>

<p>Pennant, in his &ldquo;Tour through Scotland&rdquo;
gives the following rough description of the
Game:&mdash;&ldquo;Of all the sports in those parts, that
of Curling is the favorite. It is an amusement
of the winter, and played upon the ice,
by sliding from one mark to another, great
stones of 40 to 70 lbs. weight, of a hemispherical
form, with a wooden or iron handle
at top. The object of the player is to lay
his stone as near the mark as possible, to
guard that of his partner which has been well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">- 10 -</a></span>
laid before, or to strike off that of his antagonist.&rdquo;
Such is a brief outline of that Game,
a fuller description of which is attempted in
the following pages.</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Stones" id="Stones">Stones.</a></span>&mdash;These
are made of granite, or of
any other stone which is hard, free from sand,
and not liable to break. They are cut into a
spherical form, flattened at top and bottom,
and the angles rounded off and polished,
particularly that at the sole. The handle is
inserted in the top. Though they must all
be made circular, the proportion of the diameter
to the thickness varies in different
districts; some being made more and some
less than twice as wide as they are thick. The
Grand Caledonian Curling Club has lately
suggested the following scale&mdash;the first attempt
that has been made to regulate the
proportions of Curling Stones&mdash;and which for
the sake of uniformity, it is hoped, will be
adopted, viz:&mdash;</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever be the diameter or weight, the height<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">- 11 -</a></span>
ought never to exceed 6&#8539;  inches, nor be less than 4&frac14;
inches&mdash;None ought to be allowed in a set game of
greater diameter than 12 inches, nor of a greater weight
than 50 lbs. imperial.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Stones are sometimes so finished as to slide
on either of the flattened surfaces, one of
which in such cases, is made slightly concave,
and on this side the stone is played when the
ice is hard and keen; the other, a little convex,
being used when the ice is soft and dull.</p>

<p>In some parts of Canada, where suitable
stone cannot readily be procured, iron or
wood has been substituted. At Quebec and
Montreal, castings of iron, in the shape of
Curling Stones, are played with&mdash;the intensity
of the cold there, rendering the stones
liable to break on striking against one another.
Iron is used also by the Curlers of Dundas, in
the Gore District; and at Guelph, where the
Game has some ardent admirers, they play
with blocks of hard wood. At Toronto, and
the Curling localities in the neighborhood,
stones only have been used; part having been
imported from Scotland, and others having
been made by the stone-cutter to the Club,
from blocks of excellent quality picked up by
him on the land in the vicinity. Several of
the stones imported to Toronto have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">- 12 -</a></span>
made from Ailsa Craig, which, it appears, has
long been known as an excellent material for
the purpose; one of those now referred to
having been played with by the father of the
present owner, at least sixty years ago.</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Rink" id="Rink">The Rink.</a></span>&mdash;The
ice on which the game is
played is called the Rink. This should be a
sheet of fifty yards in length and four yards
in width; perfectly free from every inequality.
At the distance of four yards from each end
of the rink, and in the middle crosswise, a
circular hole is made, about an inch in diameter
and the same in depth, called the &ldquo;tee.&rdquo;
Round the tee two or more circular lines are
drawn, the largest having a diameter of about
five feet, the others smaller and at intermediate
distances. The space within the largest
circle is called the &ldquo;brough.&rdquo; The use of the
circular lines is to shew, while the game is
being played, the comparative nearness of the
stones to the tee; actual measurement not
being allowed until all the stones have been
played to one end of the rink. A line is also
drawn across the tee, at right angles with the
rink lengthwise, and extending to the outermost
circle, the use of which will be shewn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">- 13 -</a></span>
in the remarks relating to sweeping. At the
distance of seven yards from each of the tees
a line is drawn across the rink, called the
&ldquo;hog-score,&rdquo; and stones which on being played
do not pass this score are called &ldquo;hogs&rdquo; and
lose for that time the chance of counting,
being distanced or thrown off the rink.</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Playing" id="Playing">Playing.</a></span>&mdash;When the player is about to
throw his stones, he places himself at one end
of the rink, rests his right foot in a notch, or
&ldquo;hack&rdquo; made in the ice,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and in such a relation
to the tee that when he delivers his stone
it must pass over it. He is directed by one of
the players of his own party, styled the &ldquo;skip&rdquo;
who stands at or near the tee to which the stone
is to be played, and who usually makes use
of his broom to indicate the point to which,
or the line along which, he wishes the stone
to be played. Should the stone be delivered
with the proper degree of strength, and in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">- 14 -</a></span>
direction pointed out to the player by the
skip, it will either rest at the spot required,
or receiving, as the skip intended, a new
direction by coming in contact with some
other stone, will effect the desired purpose.
The player on delivering his stone raises it
off the ice, and swinging it once behind him
to acquire a proper <i>impetus</i>, and to make
surer of his aim, keeping his eye, at the same
time, steadily fixed on the broom of the skip,
or on any stone, or other object towards or
against which he may be desired to play,
throws it in that direction. The stone reaching
the ice on its sole about two feet in front
of the player&mdash;his body naturally following
the same direction until the stone be fairly
delivered.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1" href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label1">[1]</span></a> Other
contrivances than the hack are used in some places to
prevent the foot of the player from slipping. Sometimes a thin
board is laid on the ice, on which he places both his feet. At
Toronto, the hack is considered the best, and although the Club
has &ldquo;crampits&rdquo; for the benefit of those accustomed to them, they
are required only by strangers or novices, experience demonstrating
their uselessness.</p>
</div>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sweeping" id="Sweeping">Sweeping.</a></span>&mdash;For the purpose of Sweeping,
every player is furnished with a broom, by
means of which the ice may sometimes be so
polished that a stone may reach the tee,
which, without sweeping, could not have
passed the hog score. When a stone, therefore,
in its progress up the rink appears to
the skip to have been thrown with insufficient
force, he directs his party to sweep the ice in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">- 15 -</a></span>
its path. The party opposed to that whose
stone is coming up is not allowed to sweep in
front of the line drawn across the brough, but
may sweep behind it, so as to let the stone,
if it should pass the tee, go far enough beyond
it, to lose the chance of counting.</p>

<p>The brooms used in Scotland are usually
made of &ldquo;broom,&rdquo; sometimes of birch twigs,
and occasionally of heather, as one or other
may be found most convenient to the place of
playing. In Canada, &ldquo;corn brooms&rdquo; which
have been used for domestic purposes a sufficient
length of time to be stripped of the
knotty parts which might break off and
obstruct the progress of the stone, have been
found to be the best. Some Curlers in Scarboro&rsquo;,
near Toronto, who have immigrated
from Lanarkshire, have imported stocks of
the genuine Scotch broom, which, under their
cultivation, thrives so well as to promise to
supersede the use of every other material.</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Game" id="Game">The Game.</a></span>&mdash;The usual mode of playing
the game is with 16 stones on a rink. This
number is sufficient to impart interest to the
playing, and more would towards the end of
the head, crowd the ice. Sometimes these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">- 16 -</a></span>
are played by four players on each side, playing
two stones each, which mode may be preferable
when a few only are exercising for
practice; but in such case the sweeping, which&mdash;unless
the ice be very keen&mdash;is essential to
success, can never be properly attended to, as
the skip and player being sufficiently occupied
in their own departments, only two brooms
can be effectively employed at the same time.
The most interesting game, therefore, is
where there are sixteen players on a rink, with
one stone each, eight players on each side;
and a game so played is now to be described.</p>

<p>The parties determine by lot which is to
&ldquo;have the ice&rdquo; or in other words, which is to
play the first stone. It is doubtful whether
it be an advantage to win the ice, as the party
who loses this plays the last stone&mdash;the most
important in determining the result of the
head. The side who wins the end plays the
first stone on the end following.</p>

<p>The skip of the party who is to play first,
stationing himself on that tee towards which
the stones are to be thrown, directs the player
who is to &ldquo;lead&rdquo; or play the first stone, on his
side. When this stone is played the skip of
the opposite party takes the same post, pointing
out to his first player how he wishes his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">- 17 -</a></span>
stone to be played. Each side plays one
stone alternately, and the object of each
successive player is to draw nearer the tee
than any of his opponents, to strike out their
winning shots, or to guard the winners of his
own party. The earlier stages of the end
therefore appear simple enough; but after
the first eight or ten stones have been played,
especially when they have been played well,
the game becomes more intricate and more
interesting. One party may have a stone
covering the tee, apparently guarded on every
side, and impregnable to attack, the stones of
their opponents having only strengthened its
position; yet some stone which, either from a
<i>ruse</i> on the part of the director, or from being
badly played, has rested near the edge of the
rink and seems to be lost for that end, may
furnish a point to which another stone may
be slidden, and receiving thence a new direction
may reach the winner, and removing
it from the tee, become itself the winning
stone.</p>

<p>The director generally plays the last stone
on his own side. The seventh player is
usually appointed to that position in the order
of the game on account of his being a correct
and powerful player, so that he may, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">- 18 -</a></span>
necessary, open up a path for the stone of the
&ldquo;hind hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the stones are all played to one end
of the rink, the game is counted, and every
stone which either party has nearer the tee
than any stone of their opponents, counts one
shot or point; and such portion of the game
is styled an &ldquo;end&rdquo; or &ldquo;head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The number of shots in a game is variable,
depending on agreement. The Toronto Club
usually play for 31, in a regular game; and
in their matches among themselves, or with
the Scarboro&rsquo; Curlers, when more than one
rink has been engaged, the practice has been,
either to play to an hour specified, or to stop
before that hour should the aggregate shots of
either party on all the rinks collectively
amount to thirty-one for each rink. In
Scotland, where the continuance of the curling
season is very precarious, all who have it
in their power, play the whole of every day
while the ice will permit, and, consequently,
the number of shots played for is more uniform.
At Toronto, where Curling may be
practised almost daily, fully three months in
the year, the rink is resorted to for one or two
hours&rsquo; recreation, and seven, thirteen, or
twenty-one shots are frequently fixed on as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">- 19 -</a></span>
the game, according to the time intended to
be devoted to the exercise.</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Rules" id="Rules">Laws of the Game.</a></span>&mdash;In every district of
Scotland, and in almost every club, some
differences are to be found in the mode of
conducting the game. Little difficulty, however,
is there experienced from the want of
written laws, the <i>lex non scripta</i> of every
parish or county being perfectly understood
where it is in force. Still in Edinburgh and
a few other places where Curlers from distant
Clubs are likely to meet, it has been found
necessary to have their laws reduced to writing
so that from whatever part of the country the
player might come, he could not be ignorant
of the rules by which his playing was to be
governed. At Toronto, the want of a written
code of laws, was for a number of years, felt
to be inconvenient&mdash;few of the original
Curlers having been accustomed to play
exactly according to the same system. It
was, therefore, one of the first objects of the
Toronto Curling Club, after its formation, to
draw up a set of Rules, founded on the prevailing
practice in Scotland. The following,
therefore, were agreed to&mdash;and although not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">- 20 -</a></span>
applicable to every case that may be conceived,
they have been found sufficient to
decide, satisfactorily, every difficulty that has
occurred during the experience of four years;
and have been cheerfully agreed to by the
Scarboro&rsquo; Curlers, in their matches with those
of Toronto.</p>

<div class="blockquot smfont">
<p>1st.&mdash;The Rink to be forty-two
yards from tee to tee,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. When a
game is begun the rink cannot be changed or altered
unless by the consent of a majority of players, and it
can be shortened only when it is apparent that a majority
cannot play the length.</p>

<p>2nd.&mdash;The hog score must be distant from the tee
one-sixth part of the length of the rink. Every stone
to be deemed a hog, the sole of which, when at rest,
does not completely clear the score.</p>

<p>3rd.&mdash;Every player to foot so that in delivering his
stone, it shall pass over the tee.</p>

<p>4th.&mdash;The order of playing adopted at the beginning
must not be changed during a game.</p>

<p>5th.&mdash;Curling-stones must be of a circular shape.
No stone to be changed during a game,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> unless
it happen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">- 21 -</a></span>
to be broken; and the largest fragment of such stone
to count, without any necessity of playing with it more.
If a stone roll or be upset, it must be placed upon its
sole where it stops. Should the handle quit a stone in
the delivery, the player must keep hold of it, otherwise
he will not be entitled to replay the shot.</p>

<p>6th.&mdash;The player may sweep his own stone the whole
length of the rink; his party not to sweep until it has
passed the first hog score, and his adversaries not to
sweep until it has passed the tee&mdash;the sweeping to be
always to a side.</p>

<p>7th.&mdash;None of the players, on any account, to cross
or go upon the middle of the rink.</p>

<p>8th.&mdash;If, in sweeping or otherwise, a running stone is
marred by any of the party to which it belongs, it must
be put off the rink; if by any of the adverse party, it
must be placed agreeably to the direction which was
given to the player; and if it be marred by any other
means, the player may take his shot again. Should a
stone at rest be accidentally displaced, it must be put
as near as possible in its former situation.</p>

<p>9th.&mdash;Every player must be ready when his turn
comes,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
must take only a reasonable time to play
his shot&mdash;should he, by mistake, play with a wrong
stone, it must be replaced where it stops, by the one
which he ought to have played.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">- 22 -</a></span>
10th.&mdash;A doubtful shot must be measured by a
neutral person, whose determination shall be final.</p>

<p>11th.&mdash;The skips alone shall direct the game. The
players of the respective skips may offer them their
advice, but cannot control their directions; nor is any
person, except the skip, to address him who is about to
play. Each skip may appoint one of his party to take
charge for him, when he is about to play. Every player
to follow the direction given to him.</p>

<p>12th.&mdash;Should any question arise, the determination
of which may not be provided for by the words and
spirit of the preceding Rules, each party to choose one
of their number, in order to determine it. If the two
so chosen differ in opinion, they are to name an umpire,
whose decision shall be final.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2" href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label2">[2]</span></a> The
Grand Caledonian Curling Club recommend that rinks
have double tees at each end, the one at least two yards behind the
other; the whole four to be nearly as possible on the same line.
The stones are to be delivered from the outer tee and played towards
the inner; this saves the ice from being injured around the tee
played up to.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3" href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label2">[3]</span></a> With
regard to double-soled stones, the Grand Caledonian
Curling Club has a law that the side commenced with shall not,
under forfeiture of the match, be changed during the progress of
the game.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4" href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label2">[4]</span></a> An
excellent method of obviating the confusion which is sometimes
experienced in the early ends of a game, by players being
doubtful of their places is, that before commencing, the players on
each side of a rink should &ldquo;fall in&rdquo; in the order in which it is intended
they shall play, and &ldquo;number off from right to left.&rdquo; The player
who makes a mistake after this has been done is fit neither for a
Curler nor a Soldier. This method has been practised at Toronto
since the winter of 1837-38&mdash;when military terms and ideas were
infused into every department of life.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>When a few players are curling for practice,
or recreation, some of the above laws may not
be rigidly enforced; but any relaxation should
always be noticed, so that there may be no
difficulty in strictly adhering to them when
playing a Bonspiel, or set game.</p>

<p><a name="Glossary" id="Glossary">The preceding</a> account has been, as far as
practicable, divested of technical terms, in
order that it might be the more intelligible

history,&mdash;and it would now be as difficult for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">- 23 -</a></span>

<h3>HISTORY OF CURLING</h3>

<p>The early history of Curling is involved in
such obscurity, that the time even of the
antiquarians might be better employed in
eating Beef and Greens, or in playing the
Game, than in endeavoring to discover its
origin. Some of these gentlemen have, from
the definition given of a certain word in an
old dictionary, come to the conclusion that
Curling was originally the game of quoits
played upon the ice. Kilian, in his Etymologica
Teutonicae Linguoe, renders the Teutonic
words &ldquo;<i>kluyten</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>kalluyten</i>,&rdquo; <i>ludere
massis, sive globis glaciatis; certare discis in
aequore glaciato</i>. The term kluyte, or klyte, is
still used in some parts of Scotland, where it
always signifies to &ldquo;fall flat&rdquo; or to fall so that
the broadest part of the falling body first
comes in contact with the ground; but it
never has any reference to moving on a plane
surface. The words <i>ludere</i> and <i>certare</i> throw
no light on the manner in which the <i>globus</i> or
<i>discus</i> was used. But until it can be shown
that they were moved upon the ice&mdash;not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">- 30 -</a></span>
pitched through the air&mdash;it is difficult to perceive
the relation between &ldquo;kluyten&rdquo; and
curling. As soon as the stones were played by
being slidden&mdash;if the antiquarians could only
determine the period of that event&mdash;a new
game was introduced, affording opportunities
equal to those of the quoit for muscular exercise,
and a much wider field for the exercise of
the judgment.</p>

<p>The earliest notice of Curling which has
been discovered is in Cambden&rsquo;s Britannia,
published in 1607. In it, Coppinsha, one of
the Orkney islands, is mentioned as famous
for &ldquo;excellent stones for the game called
Curling.&rdquo; This shows that it was then in
considerable repute. In the &ldquo;Life of William
Guthrie&rdquo;, who in the year 1644 was ordained
minister of Fenwick, in Ayrshire, it is stated
that he was fond of the innocent recreations
which then prevailed, &ldquo;among which was
Curling.&rdquo; In 1684, the game is taken notice
of in Fountainhall&rsquo;s Decisions. Pennycuik,
also in the seventeenth century, declares that</p>

<div class="poemtxt">
<p><span class="line1">&ldquo;To curl on the ice doth greatly please,</span><br />
<span class="line2">Being a manly Scottish exercise.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>

<p>And he celebrates the game as calculated</p>

<div class="poemtxt">
<p><span class="line1">&ldquo;To clear the brain, stir up the native heart,</span><br />
<span class="line2">And give a gallant appetite for meat.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">- 31 -</a></span>
Ramsay has alluded to Curling. Burns, in
&ldquo;Tam Samson&rsquo;s Elegy&rdquo; shows, in few words
that he himself understood the game.
Grahame, the author of the &ldquo;Sabbath&rdquo; has
illumined the rink with the lustre of his own
genius; and Curling forms the subject of a
beautiful part of &ldquo;Fisher&rsquo;s Winter Season.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="Scotland" id="Scotland">Though</a> the game has never been universal
in Scotland, it has long been practised in
almost every county south of the Forth and
the Clyde. The shires of Ayr, Renfrew,
Lanark and Dumfries are remarkable for their
attachment to Curling. It is played in Perthshire,
the Countess of Mansfield, being now
patroness of the Scone and Perth Club; but
we are not aware of its having been, until
lately, practised farther north. In Aberdeen&mdash;that
city of northern lights&mdash;it is unknown.
The Editor of the Aberdeen Herald, who is a
native of a Curling district, laments in his
paper of 13th January, 1838&mdash;that all was
then bound up in the icy stillness of the season,
and that in a place abounding with the material
for making admirable curling stones, and
with arms strong enough to wield them,</p>

<div class="poemtxt">
<p><span class="line1">&ldquo;No friendly combatants contested the field.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>

<p>The game was played near Inverness, in 1838,
when Loch-na-Sanais (or the whispering lake),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">- 32 -</a></span>
with the picturesque hills of Tomnahurich and
Torvain, echoed, for the first time, to the
booming of the stones over the ice.</p>

<p>Curling has long been held in high estimation
in Edinburgh. About the beginning of
last century &ldquo;the magistrates marched in a
body to the North Loch, to spend the day in
Curling. In going and returning they were
preceded by a band of music, playing appropriate
airs.&rdquo; It was the custom in Paisley,
not many years ago, to send round the town
drummer, after two or three nights&rsquo; hard frost,
to proclaim to the inhabitants where the
Curlers should meet in the morning; and in
the morning, should the frost continue, hundreds
might be seen&mdash;manufacturers, bailies,
weavers, and clergymen,&mdash;resorting promiscuously
to the rendezvous; for on the ice all are
on a <i>level</i>&mdash;all ordinary distinctions in society
are, for the time, forgotten in the love of the
game, and the noble and the learned are there
willing to be directed by the most skilful
player, though this should happen to be the
humblest of their neighbors.</p>

<p>In some of the agricultural districts of
Scotland, the extent of Curling Clubs is regulated
by the legal divisions of the country,
being again sub-divided among themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">- 33 -</a></span>
into rinks, who always play together under
their respective skips;&mdash;the organization
resembling in many respects that of the Militia
of Canada&mdash;and on the occasion of a contest
with another club, every man who, if in this
country should be liable to serve as a soldier,
turns out willingly for the honour of his <i>corps</i>.
There, however, age procures no exemption
from service. In the words of Grahame,</p>

<div class="poemtxt">
<p><span class="line1">&ldquo;When rival parishes and shrievedoms keep,</span><br />
<span class="line2">On upland loch, the long expected tryst,</span><br />
<span class="line2">To play their yearly bonspiel, <span class="smcap">aged men</span>,</span><br />
<span class="line2">Smit with the eagerness of youth, <span class="smcap">are there</span>,</span><br />
<span class="line2">While love of conquest lights their beamless eyes,</span><br />
<span class="line2">New nerves their arms and makes them young once more.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>
</div>

<p>On 20th January, 1838, the parish of Lesmahagow,
in Lanarkshire, met the neighboring
club of Avondale, on a sheet of ice, near
Strathaven. Each club consisted of twenty-one
rinks of eight players, making the number
of players on each side one hundred and sixty-eight,
so that three hundred and thirty-six
Curlers were engaged in the match. Such a
bonspiel as this may not take place every
season, but this instance, which is referred to,
as being of recent occurrence, is sufficient to
shew the interest which in such districts is
taken in the game, and, also, the excellence of
the organization which could bring so many
players together on a notice so short as that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">- 34 -</a></span>
which can be given, where the continuance of
hard frost cannot be depended on.</p>

<p><a name="Canada" id="Canada">It is</a> now about twenty years since Curling
was introduced to Canada, and since that time
the game has been regularly played at Quebec
and Montreal. The Clubs of those Cities, in
imitation of their friends on the other side of
the Atlantic, have occasional contests with
each other. The match which they last had,
came off in March of the present year, and
was played at both places on the same day&mdash;one-half
of the players from each City having
proceeded to the other&mdash;so that the result of
the joint game could not be known at either
place, until the parties had time to communicate.
A few years ago, the Bonspiel took
place at Three Rivers. The distance which,
in those cases, the players had to travel, sufficiently
shows how warmly they are devoted
to the game.</p>

<p>During the last winter, the officers stationed
at some of the posts to the south of Montreal,
relieved the monotony of military duty, by
engaging in Curling. The game has been
practised at Perth, in the Bathurst District,
although now fallen into disuse there. At
Niagara, a rink was formed four years ago,
one gentleman having imported a sufficient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">- 35 -</a></span>
number of stones for their use, and great
interest is now taken in the sport. At Newmarket,
about 30 miles to the north of
Toronto, there is a Curling Club, the minister,
like many of his brethren at home, being an
active promoter of the game, and an exact and
skilful player. Curling is now also a favorite
amusement at Dundas at the head of Lake
Ontario; at Guelph, in the new District of
Wellington; and at Fergus, in the township of
Nicholl. There are also, many first-rate
players in Scarboro&rsquo; who are always ready to
measure their strength, in numbers and skill,
with those of Toronto, and both enjoy the
<i>certaminis gaudia</i> in their annual bonspiel.
They played at Toronto, on 12th February
last, with twenty-four players aside, when
their Excellencies the Governor General and
the Lieutenant Governor were spectators of
the game.</p>

<p>The Fergus Club has been mentioned above,
but is worthy of more particular notice, being
perhaps, the first which was regularly organized
in Upper Canada. The settlement of
that neighborhood was begun in 1834, and the
gloom of the first winter was dispelled by the
introduction of the game. In the course of
the winter following, the Honourable Adam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">- 36 -</a></span>
Fergusson, who is the principal proprietor and
the enlightened founder of the settlement,
succeeded in forming the players into a club,
of which he was the first President, and which
now numbers upwards of thirty members.
They play with blocks of hard wood, turned
to the proper shape, which they have found to
answer the purpose, except when the ice is
dull. The experiment has been made of loading
the blocks with lead, in order that the size
and weight may bear about the same proportion
to each other as in Curling stones, and
this they consider a decided improvement.</p>

<p>The example of the Curlers of Fergus, in
constituting a club, ought to be followed in
every neighborhood where there are players
sufficient for one rink. The permanency of
the game and opportunities of playing may
thus be secured in places where, without such
arrangement, the greatest difficulty might be
experienced in bringing the players together.
Although the game has been played at
Toronto, every winter, since 1829, it was never
enjoyed to the same extent as it has been since
the formation of the Club in 1836. By the
judicious arrangement of the managers, in
appointing the hours of playing, and in having
the ice ready before the Curlers meet, the time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">- 37 -</a></span>
which was formerly wasted in preparations
that may be performed by laborers, is now
spent in the game; and thus the recreation
can be shared by many, who should otherwise,
by the nature of their occupations, be excluded
from the rink. Wherever, on this continent,
Curling has been introduced and not continued,
its decline is attributable to the want
of that system which the proper organization
of a club would ensure. Wherever Curlers
have been united, in the way now recommended,
they have been enabled to attract
constant accessions to their numbers, and, by
spreading throughout their respective neighborhoods
a love of the game, to establish its
permanency beyond the chance of decay.</p>

<p>Mr. John Graham, of New York, the best
authority in the United States, in every
matter connected with Scottish nationality,
as existing there,&mdash;and who permits his name
to be used on this occasion,&mdash;stated during his
recent visit to Toronto, that the game was
sometimes played at New York, but there
being no Club, a special arrangement was
always necessary before any meeting on the
ice could take place. If the New York
curlers were to unite, there can be no doubt
that the game would &ldquo;go a-head&rdquo; there, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">- 38 -</a></span>
that in a few winters hence, we should hear of
their having a bonspiel with their friends in
Canada, either at Montreal or Toronto.</p>

<p>A few plain rules are sufficient for the
government of a Curling Club. The following
Constitution, which was agreed upon by the
Toronto Curlers, has been found to answer
every purpose for which it was intended. A
few additional regulations have since been
made, but these are only of a local or temporary
nature.</p>
